/*
This screen essentially visualizes what the current program is running without a GUI (the current form)
It will show a more visually appealing lap times screen, a track map with driver tracker
it will show the current tyre, the typical tyre life, weather conditions, likelihood of safety cars/red flags,
it will show the pit lane time loss, the current track status (yellow flag, SC, VSC, red flag)
it will have a textbox segment that displays the current strategy recommendation. This is based on all of the information within the
program, the current track position etc. and it will state in full text:
which lap to pit on, expected rejoin position, why it is a suitable choice etc.

As the model is further developed, this should update lap by lap.
